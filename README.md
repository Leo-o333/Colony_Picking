# Creative Microbiology: A Course Designed for Automation and BioArt
Welcome to Creative Microbiology: A Course Designed for Automation and BioArt! This project aims to immerse students in a unique exploration starting from the collection and culturing of bacteria from their hands. As students progress, they delve into automating colony isolation using computer vision techniques, ultimately leveraging bacteria as colors to design their unique drawings.Experience cutting-edge laboratory equipment such as the Opentrons OT2 Robot while working through a series of pipelines for lab automation. 

By engaging with this project, students gain valuable insights and skills to streamline experiments and explore innovative solutions across various disciplines. Join us in this exciting journey at the intersection of biology and automation!
